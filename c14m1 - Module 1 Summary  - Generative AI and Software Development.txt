Module 1 Summary : Generative AI and Software Development

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that:

    AI is used to generate high-level architecture from code and provide real-time architecture updates, architectural decision-making and optimization, and architecture visualization.

    Integrating AI in DevOps processes enables automated decision-making based on real-time data by analyzing data from various sources.

    In software development, NLP is used in text processing, Named Entity Recognition (NER), text classification, chatbots and conversational agents, information extraction, and summarization.

    LLMâ€™s help in code generation and auto-completion, automated bug detection and fixing, serves as a Natural language programming interface, and improves productivity.

    Some common AI tools for website building are GPT, TeleportHQ, Visily, Framer X, Wix ADI, Webflow Sketch2React, Shopify, and Jimdo.

    ChatGPT, CodeT5, IBM watsonx Code Assistant, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot are popular AI coding tools.

    Legacy code can be characterized by outdated programming languages, lack of documentation, poor software architecture, and dependencies on obsolete technologies.

    In the future, AI will help in Efficiency enhancement, creative collaboration, new application domains, enhanced natural language processing, no-code platforms, explainable AI, intelligent assistants, and ethical AI development.

    AI algorithms can parse through the codebase, identify key modules, components, and their relationships, and generate visual representations of the software architecture.
