You can set process.env variables in Node.js from the terminal by using the command line before running your Node.js application. For example, you can set a variable like this: API_KEY=your_api_key node your_script.js. This will make API_KEY available in your script through process.env.API_KEY. clerk.com sitepoint.com
Setting process.env in Node.js
Accessing Environment Variables

In Node.js, environment variables are accessed using the process.env object. You can retrieve a variable by referencing it like this:

javascript

const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

Setting Environment Variables in the Terminal

You can set environment variables directly in the terminal before running your Node.js application. Here are two common methods:
1. Inline Setting

You can set an environment variable inline when executing your Node.js script. For example:

bash

API_KEY=your_api_key node your_script.js

This sets API_KEY for the duration of the script execution.
2. Using export

Alternatively, you can set environment variables using the export command in Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):

bash

export API_KEY=your_api_key
node your_script.js

This method makes API_KEY available to any subsequent commands in the terminal session.
Using .env Files

For better organization, you can use a .env file along with the dotenv package. Hereâ€™s how:

    Install the dotenv package:

bash

npm install dotenv

Create a .env file in your project directory and add your variables:

Code

API_KEY=your_api_key

Load the variables in your Node.js script:

javascript

    require('dotenv').config();
    const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

This approach keeps your environment variables separate from your code, enhancing security and maintainability.
